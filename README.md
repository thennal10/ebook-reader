# Ebook Reader
An ebook (read: epub) reader built with Vue, to conform to my particular sensibilities.

I started this project so I could have an ebook reader on mobile with the specific features (and without the problems) that I wanted
out of an ebook reader: mainly, EPUB support and an on-touch popup japanese dictionary. Then I got Yomichan working on mobile, so this is just now
a standard ebook reader that gives you some time taken/reading speed stats.

The reader uses your bookmarks as a log for reading sessions. Anki sync support is on the horizon, as soon as I figure out how to
ever get that to work. Or make Yomichan do it for me. Whichever one comes first.
